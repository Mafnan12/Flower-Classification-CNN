# Flower Classification using CNN and VGG16

This project focuses on classifying flower images into five categories:
Daisy, Dandelion, Roses, Sunflowers, and Tulips.

## Overview
The goal of this lab task was to design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using a custom dataset. 
The project also includes a transfer learning approach with the pre-trained VGG16 model to improve accuracy and performance.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess a custom dataset.
- Build a CNN from scratch.
- Apply transfer learning using VGG16.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, loss graphs, and a confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy / Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

## Results
- Validation accuracy achieved: around 75–85%  
- The transfer learning model performed better than the basic CNN.  
- The confusion matrix shows consistent classification across most flower categories.

## Dataset
The dataset was stored in Google Drive and contains five subfolders for each flower class.
